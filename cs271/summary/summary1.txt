  5 Assembly level, computers do not count in base 10
  6 -instead work in base 2 and base 16
  7 -everything in assembly language depends on ability to work in these
  8     bases
  9
 10 Allegory to teach different-base counting systems
 11 -base 4
 12     -count 0,1,2,3,10,11,12,13,20, etc
 13     -can be expressed by a sum of powers
 14 -base 8
 15     -count 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10, etc
 16     -also expressed as a sum of powers
 17 -base 16
 18     -count 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,10, etc
 19     -tricker to epress as sum of powers but still performed same way
 20 -base 2
 21     -count 0,1,10,11,100,101,110,111, etc
 22     -easily expressed as sum of powers of two
 23
 24 Note: Programming always starts couting *WITH* zero
 25
 26 In computers: voltage in a cricut = 1, no voltage = 0
 27
 28 Computers use hex to manage very large binary numbers with relative ease

 30 Chapter Three
 31
 32 Physical computer: changes properties of parts on a memory chip between
 33     1-bits and 0-bits to perform functions with that computer
 34 -Switches used to "remember" their configuration (on/off)
 35 -Memory is aggregate of switches that remain in position long enough
 36     to retain information
 37     -alterable
 38 -Ideally, memory should be "operated by same force it controls"
 39 -This means that memory can be moved around; in EM world this is called
 40     a "relay"
 41     -relay position flipped by appyling current
 42 -computers nowadays made from transistors
 43     -silicon switches
 44     -power flows between two points when current is applied, but does
 45      not flow when power is removed
 46     -power flowing = 1, not flowing = 0
 47 -transistor switch and its accompanying parts are called a memory cell
 48 -bits are single binary digit, 0 or 1
 49     -bits are smallest possible unit
 50 -as time goes on transistrs become more and more compact
 51 -chips consequently can have more and more of them
 52
 53 RAM
 54 -memory drawm from RAM at random
 55 -as opposed to serial-access devices (bus schedule; miss one have to wait
 56     for it to come around again) [mass storage]
 57 -each memory cell has an address
 58 -pins coming out of chips are address pins
 59     -singluar is data pin; each has an address
 60 -different chips have different times as far as how fast data appears
 61     on the pin
 62 *STAY OUT OF MEMORY when you can*
 63
 64 bit = 0 or 1
 65 bytes = 8 contiguous bits
 66 word = 2 bytes together
 67 double word = 2 words together
 68 quad word = 2 double words side by side
 69
 70 combination of memory chips doesn't affect program operation
 71
 72 each byte has own unique address!!!
 73
 74 CPU - makes sure everything gets done
 75     -talks to memory (read/write)
 76     -peripherals are other things that attach to CPU
 77         -have own I/O address
 78         -plug to motherboard
 79     -immediate work-in-progress held in registers (temp storage)
 80 Data Bus
 81     -where things are "stored" in between CPU and rest of computer
 82
 83 CPU follows machine code/instructions
 84     -CPU executes programs by getting numbers from data bus
 85     -each instruction is bite-sized
 86     -instruction pointer contains address of next instruction to be given
 87     -system clock coordinates the operaitions chronologically
 88     -instructions carried out through cascade of transistor switchings
 89     -some instructions change the order in which instructions are fetched
 90         -from instruction pointer, its address
 91     -flags in instructions can make CPU go do something completely else
 92
 93 Architecture
 94     -Combination of:
 95     -Registers
 96     -Machine instructions
 97     -Subsystems
 98 OS
 99     -manages operation of physical components
100     -software
101     -early OS's had to close when another program opened (no mem)
102     -ROM is different than RAM; keeps its stuff without power
103     -BIOS is on ROM
104     -*firmware* is on a ROM chip [good to know!]
105     -Win95 first to offer 'multitasking'
106     -Linux separated user from system space
107     -Early 2000's multiple CPU became common
