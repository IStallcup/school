strings in assembly
-also cover programming, debugging in linux
-string = contiguous bytes in memory
-no boundaries, length indicators
-defined by values you put in registers
-ESI - source string register
-EDI - dest.  string register
-STOSB: store string by byte
	-must be set: EDI destination string
	-ECX number of times you are going to store value in AL to string
	-AL must have value to store to string
	-rep repeats STOSB until ECX is zero
	-direction of EDI incrememting can be set with direction flag
	-not using rep, must manually dec ECX
	-rep can be single stepped with REP MOVSB
	
-LOOP: used for complex repetition
	-can replace jumping patterns

-IMUL:
	-similar to MUL but introduces more mistakes.

-MOVSB:
	-moves bytes from ESI is copied to EDI
	-number bytes placed in ECX register
	-Addresses in ESI, EDI adjusted by one
	-copies strings from ESI's start to EDI's start
	-also exists MOVSW, MOVSD.
