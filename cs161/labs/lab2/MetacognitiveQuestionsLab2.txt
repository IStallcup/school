Lab 2							Jeremiah Roberts

++PLANNING++
Q. Why do you think we are learning to design first, then program?

Because it is generally a better strategy to plan before you act;
this way your actions are guided by a singluar purpose and plan
that unifies all actions.

Q. What resources did you use to complete this lab?

Each other, the lab manual, Terminal RT (for Jeremiah) and PuTTY.

Q. Did you use your time wisely to finish the lab on time?

We finished this section of the lab with 40 minutes to go.

++MONITORING++
Q. What was the most difficult and confusing part of this lab?

Dealing with Terminal RT.

Q. What did you do to address the difficulties and confusions?

Learned by experimation the commands to navigate and edit code.

++EVALUATION++
Q. How well do you think you accomplished the lab?

Very well; our code compiled and accepts the appropriate inputs
and outputs the appropriate outputs.

Q. If you had to do this over, what would you have done differently?

Nothing; our program worked very well. If anything, we would have used
something other than Terminal RT if it were within our power.

Q. What worked well for you and what didn’t?
Terminal RT did not work well for us; everything else worked well.
