Part I
data to discontinuitous strings
-data to different areas of memory very quickly
-jcxz jumps when ecx goes to zero
Command-line args detailed in ch 12

Linux Virtual Memory
-linux sets up stack by declaring first byte
-see image pp426
-esp has 32-bit #; CLA counted and added
-stack at program start - pp428\
-stack address is randomized/semi-random

SCASB
-scan string by byte
-CLD clears direction flag
-EDL address of first byte of string
-value to be searched for placed in AL
-EDI points to byte after the found character's position in search string

Part II
-software interupts
-kernel services call gate represents heavily guarded gateway between user space and kernel space
-first 1024 bytes are reserved for interrupt vectors
-interrupt 80h has been pointing to services dispatches
-INT 80H jumps to kernel space
-pushes insturction of next stack instruction onto stack
-pp258
-IRET returns from interrupts
